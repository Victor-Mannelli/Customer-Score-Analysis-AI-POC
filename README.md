# Customer Score Analysis AI Project

This project, developed as part of a Python Dev course focuses on analyzing customer scores in a bank dataset. The dataset contains information on 100,000 customers, and the goal is to determine whether a customer is a good candidate for loans, credit, and other benefits based on their score.

## Overview

The analysis involves processing the dataset and implementing classification algorithms to predict customer scores. This is crucial for the bank's decision-making process regarding lending money and extending credit. The project aims to identify the most effective classification algorithms and features for predicting customer scores.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Implementation of classification algorithms
- Evaluation of model performance
- Identification of important features for score prediction

## Usage

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies as specified in the project documentation.
- Run the analysis scripts to preprocess the data, train the classification models, and evaluate their performance.
- Review the results and identify the best-performing model and important features.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Sklearn (for machine learning algorithms)
- Decision Tree (AI Model)
- Nearest Neighbors (AI Model)
